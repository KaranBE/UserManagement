For FrontEnd/reactjs
in frontend folder
install modules using

npm install -g nodemon
npm install
and then run project by "npm start"

for backend /nodejs

go to backend folder and run "npm install" for installing
and then run "npm run dev" for runing
and when both frontend and backend server gets started you are good to go :)
